Vendor provided information:

Description:

Feature:

1. Ultra-small intelligent constant temperature heating table
2. Eliminate redundancy, reserve enough effective heating area, greatly save energy consumption and heating time
3. Efficient heating area, lower energy consumption, wide range of applications, screen display and temperature control
4. Centralized preheating of running components to reduce damage to nearby components
5. USB Type-C interface + PD protocol, can speed up the heating speed

parameter:

1. Input interface: Type-C
2. Power supply: PD 65w 20v 3.25A (recommended for PD65w)
3. Temperature range: 0°C ~ 350°C [662°F]
   (the lowest temperature is the ambient temperature, which can only be raised but not lowered)
4. Shell: high-quality 3D printed shell, no delamination
5. Product size: length 5.6 cm, width 5.6 cm, height 3.5 cm

Instructions:

Double click and press at the same time: heat or stop heating
Double-click and long press to enter the menu interface or exit
Double click to confirm
Note: It is recommended that the temperature not exceed 250°C [482°F]

common problem:

Q: How many volts does the power supply need?
A: You need a charger that supports the PD protocol with a voltage of 20V 3.25A.
   In theory, it can support the PD protocol with a voltage of 220V

Q: Why does heating start from a black screen and restart?
A: This problem triggers the charger protection and needs to be replaced with another charger or data cable, most of which cause the charger model to be recorded

Package Included:

1 x Mini Heating table
